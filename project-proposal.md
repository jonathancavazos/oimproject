# Project Proposal: A.I. Voice Assistant

## The Big Idea
We want to create an artificial intelligence voice assistant to perform tasks instructed by the user. The assistant can serve various needs: checking the weather, opening a website, answering a question, providing relevant news. The general idea is to provide users an application that can make their day a little easier. Our stretch goal is to create a face that talks when responding -- as the minimal viable product is just a site with a voice button. We will utilize all that was learned in the course to build this application.

## Learning Goals
Our learning goal for this project is to make something practical and of real world value so that we can improve our Python skills. We also wanted to make a project that's intriguing and intuitive, something that we would enjoy building. We also expect this to be a nice addition to our project resumes.

## Implementation Plan
We don't have an exact implementation plan, but we anticipate that we import various python modules and libraries to create the application.
